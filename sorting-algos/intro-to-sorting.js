//What's the fuss with sorting?

//When inputs get larger and larger, the built in .sort() function would have a poor space and time complexity
// Also when you sort numbers, it will sort it according to the first number. Ie. 65. .sort will only read 6, and not 65.
//it is sorted according to string Unicode code points.
